# Xi- Cross Section

Within are the codes used to determine the production cross section for Xi- determined from the reaction gamma p -> K+ K+ Xi- -> K+ K+ pi- Lambda -> K+ K+ pi- pi- p. The results at the conclusion of membership within the collaboration are summarized in 'DocDB 4595' as presented at the Physics Working Group Meeting on July 21st, 2020.

This work used the following reconstruction and analysis versions: 
- 2017-01: reconstruction version 03, analysis launch 20
- 2018-01: reconstruction version 02, analysis launch 03
- 2018-08: reconstruction version 02, analysis launch 02
- 2018-08 Low energy: reconstruction version 02, analysis launch 05

Summary of the selection criteria:
- default analysis launch selection
- P4 and vertex kinematic fit
- mass constaint on Lambda but not XiM
- chi squared/ndf cut of 3.5

# Xi- Cross Section

Within are the codes used to determine the production cross section for Xi- determined from the reaction gamma p -> K+ K+ Xi- -> K+ K+ pi- Lambda -> K+ K+ pi- pi- p. The results at the conclusion of membership within the collaboration are summarized in DocDB 4595 as presented at the Physics Working Group Meeting on July 21st, 2020.
